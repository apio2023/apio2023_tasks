# Cyberland

The year 3742 came and now it is Cyberlandâ€™s turn to organize the APIO. In the world, there are $N$ countries indexed from $0$ to $N-1$, and $M$ bidirectional roads  (allow you to travel in both directions) indexed from $0$ to $M-1$. Every road connects two different countries, $x[i]$ and $y[i]$, and it takes a certain amount of time **$c[i]$** to pass through a road. Everyone has gone to Cyberland to compete in APIO except your country. You are living in country $0$, and Cyberland is country $H$. You are the cleverest person in your country, and your country needs your help again. They asked you the minimum time to reach Cyberland.

This time you have a complicated job because the technology is far more advanced than the past boring days like 2023. Some countries can clear your total passing time. Also, some countries can divide your total passing time by 2 ( divide-by-2 ability ). You can visit a country repeatedly. Every time you visit a country, **you may choose whether to use the special ability in the country**. But you can use the special ability **at most once in a single visit**(which means that special ability can be used multiple times by visiting the country multiple times). Moreover, you can only use the divide-by-2 ability **at most K times** in case of being caught by Cyberland Chemistry Foundation. **Once you reached Cyberland, you cannot move anywhere** because the great APIO contest will be held soon.

An array $arr$ is given, where $arr_i$ shows the special abilities of country $i$. There are $3$ types of special abilities:

- $arr_i = 0$, means this country makes the passing time $0$.
- $arr_i = 1$, means the passing time remains unchanged at this country.
- $arr_i = 2$, means this country divides the passing time by $2$.

It's guaranteed that $arr_0 = arr_H = 1$ holds.  In other words, CyberLand and your country don't have any special abilities.

Your country does not want to miss any moment of APIO, so you need to find the minimum time to reach Cyberland. If you cannot reach to Cyberland, your answer should be $-1$ .


## Implementation Details

You need to implement the following function:

`double solve(int N, int M, int K, int H, vector<int> x, vector<int> y, vector<int> c, vector<int> arr)`

- $N$: The number of countries.
- $M$: The number of bidirectional roads.
- $K$: The limit of divide-by-2 ability usage .
- $H$: The index of  the country CyberLand.
- $x,y,c$: three arrays with a length of $M$. the tuple $(x[i],y[i],c[i])$ represents the $i$-th undirected edge which connects country $x[i]$ and $y[i]$, with time cost $c[i]$.
- $arr$: an array with a length of $N$. $arr[i]$ represents the special ability of country $i$. The detail of special ability can be  found in the statement.
- For each test case, the grader may call this function for more than once. 
- Returns the minimum time to reach Cyberland from your country if you can reach Cyberland, and $-1$ if you can't do so. 

**For each function call, assume that return value of contestant's is $ans_1$, and the return value of standard's is $ans_2$, your return value is considered correct if and only if $\frac{|ans_1 - ans_2|}{\max\{ans_2, 1\}} \le 10^6$**.

Note: **Since the function will be called more than once, contestants need to pay attention to the impact of the remaining data of the previous call on the current call.**

 

## Examples

### Example 1

Consider the following call:

`solve(3, 2, 30, 2, [1, 2], [2, 0], [12, 4], [1, 2, 1])`

The only path to Cyberland is $0 \to 2$, because you can not move to anywhere after reaching CyberLand. The calculation of passing time is shown as below.

| country number | passing time |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0         | 0                            |
| 2         | 0 + 4 $\rightarrow$ 4(sum) $\rightarrow $ 4(special ability)|

Therefore, the procedure should return $4$.

### Example 2

Consider the following call:

`solve(4, 4, 30, 3, [0, 0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3, 3], [5, 4, 2, 4], [1, 0, 2, 1])`.

There are two paths from your country to Cyberland. They are: $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$ and $0 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$.

If your path is $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$ , the calculation of passing time is shown as below. 

| country number | passing time |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0         | 0                            |
| 1         | 0 + 5 $\rightarrow $ 5(sum) $\rightarrow $ 0(special ability) |
| 3         | 0 + 2 $\rightarrow$ 2(sum) $\rightarrow $ 2(special ability)|

If your path is $0 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$, the calculation of passing time is shown as below.
| country number | passing time |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0         | 0                            |
| 2         | 0 + 4 $\rightarrow $ 4(sum) $\rightarrow $ 2(special ability) |
| 3         | 2 + 4 $\rightarrow$ 6(sum) $\rightarrow $ 6(special ability)|

Therefore, the procedure should return $2$.

## Sample grader

The sample grader reads the input in the following format:

- line $1$: $T$

For each of the following $T$ test cases:

- line $1$: $N\ M\ K$
- line $2$: $H$
- line $3$: $arr[0]\ arr[1]\ arr[2]\ ...\ arr[N-1]$
- line $4+i(0\le i \le M-1)$: $x[i]\ y[i]\ z[i]$

The sample grader prints your answers in the following format:

For each test cases:

- line $1$:  the return value of solve
